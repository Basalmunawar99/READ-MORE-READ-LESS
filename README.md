**Read More / Read Less Button**
This project showcases a simple "Read More / Read Less" button functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to toggle between viewing a short and extended version of a story on the page.

**Demo**
When the page loads, only a part of the story is visible. The user can click the "Read More" button to expand and read the full story. Upon clicking "Read Less," the additional part of the story is hidden again, returning the page to its initial state.

**Features**
Toggle Button: Expands or collapses the text when clicked.
Smooth Transitions: The hidden text fades in and out for a smooth user experience.
Cool UI: The page features a glowing title, dark background, and a modern button design.
Responsive Design: The layout is responsive and works on devices of various sizes.
**Technologies Used**
HTML: Structure of the page.
CSS: Styling for a modern, clean look with animation effects.
JavaScript: Logic for toggling between the "Read More" and "Read Less" states.
